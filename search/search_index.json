In the case of Dias this is also the head node which manages the cluster.

You are encouraged to run normal editing and development work on the login node however, so you can edit files, download data, check your work into repositories, move files around and so on without a problem.</p> <p>When you come to run intensive jobs, you must request a job from the job manager, which in the case of Dias is software called Slurm (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management). This software will allocate your job to one of the two CPU nodes, or the GPU node. If Dias is busy there may be a wait for resources, but Slurm tries to allocate resources fairly so that users get an appropriate share of the time.</p> <p>Resources are divided into partitions which contain different types of hardware - for Dias these are normal CPU nodes in the COMPUTE partition, one GPU node in the GPU partition, and one GPU node in the LIGHTGPU partition.</p>"},{"location":"clusters/dias/#submitting-a-job-to-slurm","title":"Submitting a job to Slurm","text":"<p>To submit a job you must write a bash script that has the commands needed to run your code, and also includes directives to Slurm for what resources are needed.

Two of these nodes have 10 V100 GPUs, each capable of 7 Tflops double precision, 14 Tflops single precision, and 112 Tflops half precision, with 16 GB RAM on the GPU. Two further nodes have 5 and 4 A100 GPUs each capable of 9.7 Tflops double precision, 19.5 Tflops single precision, and 312 Tflops half precision, and either 40 GB or 80 GB memory (4x 80 GB, and 4x 40 GB plus 1 80 GB).</p> <p>A fifth node has 4 80 GB A100 GPUs connected by NVLink, which much upgrades the communication between the GPUs and particularly suits multiple GPU work. It has 512GB RAM and 32 Xeon Silver 4314 cores.</p> <p>The sixth node has 64 AMD EPYC cores, 1.5TB memory, and 10 L40S cards. The L40S cards each have 48GB on board memory, and for many tasks are comparable in speed to an A100 card but have poor double precision performance.</p> <p>The A100 cards are very popular due to their higher speed, memory capacity and improved feature set. As a result of their popularity queue times to get on to A100 cards can be quite long. However, the V100 cards are still very capable, and are sufficient for many tasks. Use of the V100 cards is encourage to alleviate pressure on the A100 cards, so if your job doesn\u2019t require the memory or features of the A100 please consider using V100s instead. The slight increase in job times will often be compensated by reduced queuing and this makes the cluster more efficient for everyone. The L40S cards as stated above are also excellent for many tasks, but will be very slow for double precision calculations so it's best to do small test runs on these cards first to see if they suit your code.</p> <p>Further Grace Hopper systems are due to be installed soon, which will expand these options further.</p> <p>The GPU nodes have CUDA installed natively, and Apptainer (formerly Singularity) is available if you need to run a containerised OS (contact Edd if you'd like more info on this).
