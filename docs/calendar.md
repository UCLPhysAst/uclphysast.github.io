Departmental events are included in an Outlook calendar: [PhysAst.Events](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/8f8821f86233465f8dacb48d0d2a576f%40live.ucl.ac.uk/86d1484ea2a1443d9470f94ed4fbf43c16928893683773856080/calendar.html).

To include it in your preferred calendar application, you wil need to refer to instructions for the specific application. As an example, if you are using the [Outlook Calendar web interface](https://outlook.office.com/calendar/), you can

- ensure you are logged in using your UCL account;
- click "Add calendar";
- select "Add from directory", and select your UCL account under "Please select an account to search from";
- type "PhysAst.Events" and click the entry that appears;
- under "Add to", select "Other calendars" and click "Add".

You should now see entries from the departmental calendar alongside those from your own calendar and any others you have added.
