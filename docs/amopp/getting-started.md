# Remote Access to Cluster Resources

Computing services are accessible from inside the UCL however, if you wish to connect from outside UCL, you need to either connect via the UCL VPN or use SSH to log in to the Gateway node that is accessible from the outside and use that to "jump" to the required resource.

## Connecting to the gateway node

You can connect to the jump boxes by connecting with your SSH client to:

```
ssh0.theory.phys.ucl.ac.uk
```

Once connected you can then log on to the node you wish to use.
