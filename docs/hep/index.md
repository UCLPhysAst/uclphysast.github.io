# High-Energy Physics (HEP)

For IT support in the HEP group please e-mail [support@hep.ucl.ac.uk](mailto:support@hep.ucl.ac.uk).

## HEP computing information

Information for members of the HEP group can be found on the [HEP Computing Wiki](https://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/twiki/bin/view/Computing). If you don't already have access you should click `TWikiRegistration` on the login page and fill in the registration form. Registrations are dealt with by the support team so you will have to wait a while for us to approve your account. To help us deal with your application quickly it helps if you include:

- your UCL e-mail address if you have one;
- a brief statement of your role and/or supervisor in the "comment" field so we know you are part of the HEP group.

## New accounts

To request a new account, e-mail [support@hep.ucl.ac.uk](mailto:support@hep.ucl.ac.uk) stating:

- the full name and e-mail address of the person needing the account;
- the role of the account holder (e.g. new academic or postdoc, PhD student, project or summer student);
- the supervisor or line manager of the account holder;
- how long the account is needed for (typically a year for a project student, longer for others, but can be extended later);
- the preferred user name (generally the user's surname, or initial(s) + surname);
- any groups (e.g. atlas, nemo...) the account should be added to (these can also be added later).
