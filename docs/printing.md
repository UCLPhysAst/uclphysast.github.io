# Printing and Scanning

There are various multifunction devices (MFDs) around the department that can be used to print, copy and scan documents. They are available through the [Print@UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/print-copy-scan-services) service.

Devices are available on each floor of the Physics Building:

- in the mail room on the ground floor (E);
- in the print room next to the list on A floor;
- in the corridor on floors D to B.
