# Central UCL Clusters (ARC)

UCL's [Advanced Research Computing Centre (ARC)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/) hosts a range of computating facilities including several large clusters, documented on the [
UCL Research Computing Documentation](https://www.rc.ucl.ac.uk/docs/) web site.

- [Myriad](https://www.rc.ucl.ac.uk/docs/Clusters/Myriad/) is designed for high I/O, high throughput jobs that will run within a single node rather than multi-node parallel jobs.
- [Kathleen](https://www.rc.ucl.ac.uk/docs/Clusters/Kathleen/) is a compute cluster designed for extensively parallel, multi-node batch-processing jobs, having high-bandwidth connections between each individual node.
- [Young](https://www.rc.ucl.ac.uk/docs/Clusters/Young/) is the compute cluster for the UK National Tier 2 High Performance Computing Hub in Materials and Molecular Modelling.
- [Michael](https://www.rc.ucl.ac.uk/docs/Clusters/Michael/) is an extension to the UCL-hosted Hub for Materials and Molecular Modelling, delivering computational capability for the Faraday Institution, a national institute for electrochemical energy storage science and technology.
