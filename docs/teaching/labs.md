# Teaching Labs

The PCs in the three teaching labs in the Physics Building are mostly installed with the UCL Windows environment Desktop@UCL. The same software available on these computers can also be used on other Desktop@UCL PCs on campus, and remotely via the Desktop@UCL Anywhere service. See [Computers](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/computers) on the ISD web site.

Some computers in the teaching labs are set up differently or have additional software installed for use with specific experiments. This will be explained to you by the staff running the relevant lab course.
